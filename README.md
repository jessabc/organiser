# Organiser

This frontend app made with React uses previous UI and code from Frontend Mentor's Kanban challenge.
- Solution URL: [Github](https://github.com/jessabc/kanban-task-management)
- Live Site URL: [Kanban Task Management](https://kanbantaskmanagement.netlify.app)

The UI is also inspired by a recent Chingu Voyage Daily Tasker app 
[Github](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v47-tier2-team-10))
  
The app adds an expense tracker feature to make it an 'organiser' for the user.

Continuous improvements include adding Next.js features, Typescript, and a backend.
